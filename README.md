# NewsHub
By [Nick Hart](https://github.com/nickhartdev/)

### Overview  
NewsHub is the start of an ongoing project - an application with the goal of making access to information more equitable. This first iteration uses the News API in conjunction with i18n to give Spanish and English speakers the ability to quickly sort through news by categories that interest them, with the goal of adding additional language support later on. This was the final solo project completed within the third quarter at the Turing School of Software and Design.

### Technologies Used:
* React
* React Hooks
* i18n
* React Testing Library
* moment.js

### Setup/Installation
- Clone the front-end repo using `git clone git@github.com:nickhartdev/NewsHub.git`
- Run `npm install` in the root of the newly created directory to install the necessary dependencies
- Running `npm start` in your terminal should launch the application in your browser. If not, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the application in action
